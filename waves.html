               <h2>First Wave</h2>
               <p>
                COVID-19 was first reported in the UK at the end of January 2020 and lockdown announced on 23 March 2020. Many of us have uttered the words ‘when this is over’,
                 but what does that really mean?  
                 We are currently experiencing the effects of the first wave, where deaths and disability are directly linked to COVID-19. Alongside the atrocious death toll, an as yet untold number of people are living with the lasting aftermath of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection—for some, even mild COVID-19 can be debilitating for months on end, even after t
                  clinically cured of the infection.1

               <h2>Second Wave</h2>
               <p>
                The second wave refers to those who will suffer in the medium-term due to measures taken to limit the spread of COVID-19. It includes, among many others, those who delay presenting to healthcare facilities for fear of COVID-19 infection; those with progressive diseases whose appointments are rescheduled; and those who miss routine screening. The question of how doctors, particularly those working in primary care, 
                will navigate the backlog remains unanswered.

            <h2>Third Wave</h2>
            <p>
                The third wave is the effect of virus on the social determinants of health, and its effects on the next generation.2 The virus will worsen health inequalities through severe economic injury.3 It is the sectors that rely on low-paid staff (often women, young people and Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people) that will take longest to recover from the predicted deep economic recession.3 The health impacts caused by this worsening of economic conditions will be complex, but it is likely
                 that groups that are at the intersection between poverty and poor health that will suffer most.3
